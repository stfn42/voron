# Voron 0.2 No Drop Nut Door Latch

No Drop Nuts (https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/zruncho/V0_No_Drop_Nuts) are amazing and make life a lot easier.

While you can use the regular no drop nuts for nearly everything, there are special variants for the door latches on the repo and if you're building your first V0, it's not impossible to preload the regular variant since you might not realize what they end up being used for. It happened to me and, since you're here, there's a good chance it happened to you.

This is an extended remix of the original part to accommodate two regular no drop nuts to mount the door latch while maintaining the original magnet spacing.

Note: This leads to the latch extending further up than the original door handle, which is a mild aesthetics issue. If this bothers you, consider designing your own door handle or changing the Voron handle accordingly.
